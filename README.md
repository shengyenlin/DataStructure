# Data Structure
These practices or exercises are done when I was learning data structures from the following two books/courses on my own .

- Data Stuctures and Advanced Programming (NTUIM, taught by Ling-Chieh, Kung) 
- Data Structures Using C++, Second Edition, D.S. Malik

Each exercise is written in C++14 with g++ compiler.\
I implemented the following data structure (with ADT) and also finished some practices with C++ standard template library (C++ STL).

- C++ STL 
    - iterator
    - vector
    - deque
    - list
- Linked list
    - unordered linked list
    - ordered linked list
    - doubly linked list
    - linked list with header and trailer node (to be finished)
    - circular linked list (to be finished)
- Recursion
    - Decimal system to binary system
- Stack
- Queue (to be finished)
- Binary trees (to be finished)
- Graphs (to be finished)
